# Feelings Wheel Enhancement Design Suggestions
## Principal Designer & Emotion-Based Therapy Specialist Collaboration

### Executive Summary

This document outlines strategic design enhancements for the Feelings Wheel application, developed through collaboration between a principal designer and an experienced therapist specializing in Emotion-Based Therapy (EBT). The recommendations focus on creating a therapeutic information panel system that supports emotional exploration, understanding, and processing while maintaining clinical integrity and user accessibility.

### Therapeutic Framework Foundation

#### Emotion-Based Therapy Core Principles
- **Emotions as Adaptive Guides**: All emotions serve a purpose and carry important information
- **Primary vs. Secondary Emotions**: Distinguishing between immediate emotional responses and complex reactions
- **Emotional Granularity**: Developing sophisticated emotional vocabulary for enhanced self-awareness
- **Somatic Awareness**: Connecting emotional experiences to physical sensations
- **Therapeutic Relationship**: Creating safety for emotional exploration and expression

#### Clinical Integration Goals
- Support therapists in facilitating emotional awareness sessions
- Provide educational tools for clients to explore emotions independently
- Enhance the therapeutic relationship through shared exploration
- Maintain clinical appropriateness while improving accessibility

### Information Panel System Design

#### Layout and Positioning
**Primary Recommendation**: Position the information panel on the right side of the interface, creating a 70/30 split between the wheel and information space.

**Design Rationale**:
- Maintains the wheel as the primary focus while providing contextual support
- Follows natural left-to-right reading patterns for Western audiences
- Allows for responsive collapsing on smaller screens
- Creates visual hierarchy that supports the therapeutic process

#### Panel Content Structure

##### 1. Default State (No Emotions Selected)
**Content**: Simple, encouraging instructions for wheel interaction
**Therapeutic Language**:
- "Welcome to your emotional exploration journey"
- "Click any emotion to learn more about what it means and how it might show up in your life"
- "Rotate the wheel to explore different emotional families"
- "Remember: All emotions are valid and carry important information"

**Design Elements**:
- Soft, inviting color palette
- Minimal text to reduce cognitive load
- Subtle animation to indicate interactivity
- Clear, sans-serif typography for accessibility

##### 2. Single Emotion Selected
**Content Structure**:
- **Emotion Name**: Large, clear heading
- **Simple Definition**: Age-appropriate explanation
- **Physical Sensations**: "You might notice..." section
- **Emotional Function**: "This emotion helps you..." section
- **Healthy Expression**: "Healthy ways to express this emotion..."
- **Related Emotions**: Visual connection to emotion families

**Adult Mode Example - "Frustrated"**:
```
FRUSTRATED
A feeling that arises when something blocks your path to a goal or desire.

You might notice:
• Tension in your jaw or shoulders
• Feeling restless or agitated
• Urge to take action or problem-solve
• Difficulty concentrating

This emotion helps you:
• Recognize when something isn't working
• Motivate change or problem-solving
• Identify your values and priorities
• Persist through challenges

Healthy ways to express this emotion:
• Take deep breaths and pause
• Talk to someone you trust
• Write about what's bothering you
• Channel energy into physical activity
• Focus on what you can control

Remember: Frustration often signals that something important to you is being blocked. It's your inner wisdom alerting you to pay attention.
```

**Children's Mode Example - "Frustrated"**:
```
FRUSTRATED
When something gets in your way and you can't do what you want.

Your body might feel:
• Tight in your chest
• Like you want to move around
• Hot or warm

This feeling helps you:
• Know when something isn't fair
• Find new ways to solve problems
• Ask for help when you need it

What you can do:
• Take three deep breaths
• Count to ten
• Tell a grown-up how you feel
• Draw a picture of your feeling
• Give yourself a hug

Remember: Everyone feels frustrated sometimes. It's okay to feel this way!
```

##### 3. Multiple Emotions Selected
**Content Structure**:
- **Emotion Comparison**: Side-by-side exploration
- **Emotional Complexity**: "It's normal to feel multiple emotions"
- **Relationship Mapping**: How emotions interact and influence each other
- **Integration Guidance**: Moving forward with complex feelings

#### Therapeutic Relationship Content

##### Primary and Secondary Emotion Relationships
**Based on EBT Research**:
- **Anger as Secondary**: Often masks hurt, fear, or disappointment
- **Anxiety as Messenger**: Frequently signals unprocessed emotions beneath
- **Depression Patterns**: May indicate suppressed anger or unresolved grief
- **Shame vs. Guilt**: Distinguishing between self-worth and behavior

**Implementation Example**:
```
ANGER & SADNESS SELECTED

These emotions often appear together because:
• Anger can be a way of protecting yourself from feeling hurt
• Sadness underneath anger is often about loss or disappointment
• Both are trying to help you process something important

Consider asking yourself:
• What am I protecting by feeling angry?
• What might I be sad about losing?
• How can I honor both of these feelings?
```

##### Emotional Precursors and Underlying Patterns
**Therapeutic Insight Integration**:
- **Anger Precursors**: Often rooted in hurt, fear, or boundary violations
- **Anxiety Patterns**: May stem from unresolved trauma or anticipatory fears
- **Depression Signals**: Could indicate suppressed emotions or existential concerns
- **Joy Blocks**: Sometimes hindered by guilt, fear of loss, or past trauma

#### Children's Mode Enhancements

##### Age-Appropriate Language Framework
**3-6 Years**: Simple, concrete language with visual metaphors
**7-10 Years**: Expanded vocabulary with relatable examples
**11-14 Years**: More sophisticated concepts with peer-relevant contexts

##### Interactive Elements for Children
- **Emotion Families**: Visual representation of emotion groups
- **Feeling Thermometer**: Intensity scales for emotional awareness
- **Coping Toolbox**: Age-appropriate regulation strategies
