# Feelings Wheel - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Enhancement of the Feelings Wheel web application with advanced UI/UX features, therapeutic content, and improved user experience.

## Implementation Approach
- **Design Mindset**: Senior web app designer - focus on user experience, accessibility, and therapeutic effectiveness
- **Engineering Mindset**: Senior software engineer - efficient, maintainable, and performant code
- **Content Standards**: All therapeutic content sourced from real materials by emotion-based therapy experts; definitions from actual dictionary entries
- **Validation**: Implement one feature at a time with validation stops between each

## Phase 1: UI Additions

### 1.1 Fixed Shadow System âœ… COMPLETED & VALIDATED
- **Goal**: Shadows rotate as if from a fixed light source
- **Status**: Successfully implemented, debugged, and validated
- **Fix Applied**: Corrected shadow offset rotation speed for realistic physics
- **Notes**: Shadows now behave authentically with fixed light source from top-left

### 1.2 Animation Improvements
- **Goal**: 60fps transitions and micro-interactions
- **Components**:
  - Anti-aliasing for smooth SVG rendering
  - Smooth reset animations (unroll effect)
  - 60fps animation engine
  - Micro-interactions for hover/selection states
- **Status**: Pending implementation

### 1.3 Right-side Panel
- **Goal**: 70/30 split between wheel and information space
- **Layout**: Responsive design that adapts to screen size
- **Status**: Pending implementation

## Phase 2: Panel Content

### 2.1 Definitions System
- **Standard Mode**: Comprehensive dictionary definitions for all emotions
- **Simplified Mode**: Children's dictionary definitions with age-appropriate language
- **Source**: Real dictionary entries relevant to emotional content
- **Status**: Pending implementation

### 2.2 Therapeutic Context
- **Content**: Emotion relationships and precursor information
- **Source**: Materials from emotion-based therapy experts
- **Features**:
  - Show how emotions connect and influence each other
  - Understanding what triggers certain emotions
- **Status**: Pending implementation

### 2.3 Usage Instructions
- **Goal**: Contextual help when no emotions are selected
- **Content**: Guide users on how to use the wheel effectively
- **Status**: Pending implementation

### 2.4 Emotion Relationships
- **Goal**: Visual and textual representation of emotion connections
- **Features**: Interactive exploration of emotional dependencies
- **Status**: Pending implementation

### 2.5 Emotional Precursors
- **Goal**: Understanding triggers and pathways to emotions
- **Content**: Educational information about emotional development
- **Status**: Pending implementation

## Technical Requirements

### Content Sourcing Standards
- **Definitions**: Real dictionary entries (Merriam-Webster, Oxford, etc.)
- **Therapeutic Content**: Materials by licensed therapists and emotion-based therapy experts
- **Children's Content**: Age-appropriate language (elementary reading level)
- **No Arbitrary Content**: All content must be researched and sourced

### Performance Standards
- **60fps**: All animations and interactions
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Accessible**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Cross-browser**: Modern browser compatibility

### Quality Assurance
- **Testing**: Thorough testing after each implementation
- **Validation**: User validation between phases
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of features and approaches

## Current Status
- **Completed**: Fixed Shadow System (Phase 1.1)
- **Next**: Animation Improvements (Phase 1.2)
- **Overall Progress**: 1/8 major components completed

## Notes
- Implementation follows one-at-a-time approach with validation stops
- All changes are version controlled with meaningful commits
- Focus on maintaining existing functionality while adding new features
