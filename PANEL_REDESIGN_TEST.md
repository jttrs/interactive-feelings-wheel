### **🎯 1. Control Instructions Test**
**Goal**: Verify new instructions are clear and accurate

#### **Instructions Display**:
1. **Load page** - panel should show instructions by default
2. **Verify Content**:
   - ✅ "Click on any emotion in the wheel to learn more about it" intro
   - ✅ "How to Use the Wheel" section with 4 controls:
   - ✅ 🖱️ "Click & drag to rotate"
   - ✅ 🖲️ "Scroll wheel to rotate" 
   - ✅ 👆 "Click emotions to select"
   - ✅ ⌨️ "Press F11 for fullscreen"

#### **Verify All Controls Work**:
1. **Mouse drag**: Click and drag wheel → rotates smoothly
2. **Mouse wheel**: Scroll over wheel → rotates in direction
3. **Click selection**: Click any emotion → selects with visual feedback
4. **F11 fullscreen**: Press F11 → enters fullscreen mode

---

### **🎮 2. Panel Footer Controls Test**
**Goal**: Verify controls moved from floating panel work correctly

#### **Control Layout**:
1. **Check footer** contains three controls:
   - ✅ Simplified mode toggle (left side)
   - ✅ Fullscreen button (center-right)
   - ✅ Reset button (right)

#### **Simplified Mode Toggle**:
1. **Toggle simplified mode** → check slider animates
2. **Select an emotion** → definition should be child-friendly language
3. **Toggle back to standard** → definition should be formal/complete
4. **Multiple tiles** → all definitions should update when toggled

#### **Fullscreen Button**:
1. **Click fullscreen** → enters fullscreen mode
2. **Button state** → becomes active/highlighted
3. **Press ESC** → exits fullscreen, button returns to normal
4. **F11 key** → still works as alternate method

#### **Reset Button**:
1. **Select 2-3 emotions** → tiles appear
2. **Click reset** → all selections cleared, tiles removed
3. **Instructions** → should reappear when no selections

---

### **🏗️ 3. Panel Minimization Test**
**Goal**: Verify sleek panel collapse/expand functionality

#### **Minimization Control**:
1. **Locate arrow tab** on left edge of panel (should show ◀)
2. **Click tab** → panel smoothly collapses to width 0
3. **Grid layout** → wheel should expand to fill full width
4. **Arrow direction** → should change to ▶ (pointing right)

#### **Restoration**:
1. **Click tab again** → panel smoothly expands back
2. **Content restoration** → all tiles and state preserved
3. **Arrow direction** → returns to ◀ (pointing left)
4. **Layout** → returns to 70/30 split

#### **Mobile Behavior**:
1. **Resize to mobile** width (<768px)
2. **Minimization tab** → should be hidden on mobile
3. **Panel** → should remain visible as bottom panel

---

### **📚 4. Dictionary API Integration Test**
**Goal**: Verify real dictionary definitions are fetched and displayed

#### **Single Emotion Selection**:
1. **Click emotion "Happy"** → tile appears with loading state
2. **Wait for API** → definition should load from dictionary
3. **Verify content**:
   - ✅ Emotion name as title
   - ✅ Level badge (Core/Secondary/Tertiary)
   - ✅ Family badge (parent emotion)
   - ✅ Real dictionary definition (not basic fallback)

#### **Different Emotions**:
1. **Test Core emotion** (e.g., "Sad") → should get full definition
2. **Test Secondary emotion** (e.g., "Frustrated") → should get definition
3. **Test Tertiary emotion** → should get definition or fallback

#### **API Error Handling**:
1. **Disconnect internet** (if possible)
2. **Select emotion** → should show fallback definition gracefully
3. **No error messages** → user shouldn't see technical errors

#### **Simplified Mode Definitions**:
1. **Toggle simplified mode**
2. **Select emotion** → definition should use child-friendly language
3. **Compare to standard** → simplified should be clearly easier to understand

### **📊 5. Emotion Tile Stacking System Test**
**Goal**: Verify tile behavior with multiple selections

#### **First Selection**:
1. **Select one emotion** → tile appears expanded with full definition
2. **Tile state** → should be expanded, showing complete content
3. **Instructions** → should disappear when tile appears

#### **Second Selection**:
1. **Select second emotion** → new tile appears at top
2. **New tile** → should be expanded with definition
3. **Previous tile** → should collapse to just name bar
4. **Order** → newest on top, oldest at bottom

#### **Third+ Selections**:
1. **Select third emotion** → appears at top, expanded
2. **Previous tiles** → all collapse to name bars
3. **Stack order** → newest always on top

#### **Tile Interactions**:
1. **Click collapsed tile** → should expand and become active
2. **Previous active** → should collapse when new one expands
3. **Remove button (×)** → should remove tile and deselect in wheel
4. **Color coding** → each tile should match its wedge color
