# Feelings Wheel - Interactive Emotion Explorer

An interactive web application displaying a therapeutic feelings wheel based on Geoffrey Roberts' Emotional Word Wheel design. This tool helps users explore emotional vocabulary through an engaging, rotatable interface with visual emphasis for selected emotions.

## üéØ Features

### Interactive Wheel Design
- **7 Core Emotions**: Happy, Surprised, Bad, Fearful, Angry, Disgusted, Sad
- **Three-Ring Structure**: Core emotions in center, secondary emotions in middle ring, tertiary emotions in outer ring
- **Authentic Colors**: Each core emotion has its own color family that lightens toward the outer rings
- **Dynamic Sizing**: Wheel automatically fills available browser space

### Interactive Controls
- **Full Rotation**: Click and drag to rotate the wheel smoothly
- **Mouse Wheel Support**: Scroll to rotate the wheel
- **Multi-Selection**: Click wedges to emphasize multiple emotions simultaneously
- **Visual Emphasis**: Selected wedges get enhanced colors, brightness, and subtle shadows
- **Reset Function**: Small reset button positioned just inside the wheel's edge

### Advanced Visual Features
- **Layered Shadows**: Shadows render over unemphasized wedges but never cover emphasized ones
- **Radial Text**: All emotion labels are oriented along radii toward the center
- **Text Rotation**: Text maintains proper orientation as the wheel rotates
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to any screen size and aspect ratio

### User Experience
- **Minimal Interface**: Clean design with only essential elements
- **No Side Panels**: Focus remains entirely on the wheel
- **Smooth Animations**: Elegant transitions for all interactions
- **Touch Support**: Works on mobile devices

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Wheel Structure
- **Core Ring**: 7 emotions with dynamic sizing based on secondary emotion count
- **Middle Ring**: Secondary emotions with equal-width wedges within each core section
- **Outer Ring**: Tertiary emotions with half-width wedges for detailed specificity

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Base Layer**: All unemphasized wedges and text
- **Shadow Layer**: Shadows of emphasized wedges (renders above unemphasized, below emphasized)
- **Top Layer**: Emphasized wedges and their text (always visible, never covered)

### Dynamic Features
- **Responsive Sizing**: Wheel uses 99% of available space, adapting to container dimensions
- **Smart Positioning**: Reset button dynamically positions based on actual wheel boundaries
- **Color Gradients**: Systematic lightening from core (original colors) to middle (25% lighter) to outer (70% lighter)

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with filters and transforms
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Dynamic SVG generation and interaction
- **SVG**: Scalable vector graphics for crisp rendering at any size
